# Squeeze - C++20 Compile time string compression

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/AshleyRoll/squeeze/actions/workflows/build_and_test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AshleyRoll/squeeze/actions/workflows/build_and_test.yml)


Experiments in building complex compile time executed code using
`constexpr` functions to generate a compressed string table.

More details to come, but basically this allows building a Huffman Encoded
string table (keyed by index or enum) at compile time.
